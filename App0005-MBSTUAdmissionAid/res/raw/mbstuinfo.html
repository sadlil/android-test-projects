library collection is sufficient enough for any student of any department to acquire knowledge on his subjects. The central library is equipped with 
photocopying machines.
The central library is proposed to emerge into an electronic library soon so that it can run more flexibly and the students can get the chance to take the 
advantage of the library to the fullest.
Besides the Central Library, every department has its own seminar library to fulfill the demands of the students and teachers. Every department\'s Seminar 
Library has a vast collection of books on topics within and beyond the academic courses of that department.
